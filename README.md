### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Zurab Siprashvili, a seasoned software engineer and development team leader. With many years of experience in the industry, I specialize in JavaScript, with a strong focus on React, React Native, and Node.js. I'm passionate about crafting clean, efficient code and thrive on solving complex challenges, as well as mentoring junior developers.

ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm leading development teams for Enterprise and startup companies, where I oversee the entire development lifecycle. This includes managing development processes, resolving daily challenges, designing robust solutions, and guiding teams through implementation. I also actively contribute to projects as senior engineer, leveraging my expertise to drive innovation and collaboration in the developer community.

ðŸŒ± Throughout my career, I've remained dedicated to continuous learning and exploration of new technologies. In addition to my proficiency in JavaScript, I have extensive experience with databases such as PostgreSQL and DynamoDB, and I'm proficient in Golang. My AWS/GCP engineering skills enable me to design and maintain highly available and reliable infrastructures using tools like Terraform, AWS-SAM, or gcloud/aws CLIs.
